________________________________________________________________________________

Android Toolbox is a library and function collection which can be used in
various applications. Every tool will be well documented and describe how to use
it and what dependencies it has.

The toolbox should remain lightweight (so no heavy resources, only simple
layouts or custom attribute definitions). Tools with heavy resources are located
in separate projects.
So you can decide what you you want to reuse by simply excluding classes from
project build path and including needed library projects. Class dependencies
are documented at the bottom of every class documentation.

Available libraries in project:

jcifs-1.3.16.jar			http://jcifs.samba.org/
	Samba access with Java.
